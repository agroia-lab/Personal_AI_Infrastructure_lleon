# 🧪 PLAN EXPERIMENT WORKFLOW

Guides planning and designing experiments with structured methodology.

## 🎯 WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Gather Requirements

Ask the user about:
- **Hypothesis**: What are you testing?
- **Variables**: Independent, dependent, and control variables
- **Controls**: What needs to be held constant?
- **Success Metrics**: How will results be measured?

### Step 2: Design Experiment

Structure the experimental design:
- Define clear objectives
- Identify potential confounds
- Plan data collection methods
- Determine sample sizes and replication

### Step 3: Document Plan

Create structured experiment plan with all parameters defined.
