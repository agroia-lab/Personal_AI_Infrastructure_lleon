# Extract Methods Workflow

## Purpose
Extract detailed methodology from papers for protocol generation and experimental replication.

## Usage
```
Extract methodology from paper for protocol generation
```

## Input
- Paper identifier or full text
- Target extraction level (overview, detailed, step-by-step)
- Specific methods section to focus on

## Process
1. Locate and parse methods section
2. Extract experimental protocols
3. Identify materials and reagents used
4. Document analysis techniques
5. Capture statistical methods
6. Structure as reproducible protocol

## Output
- Structured methodology document
- Materials list
- Step-by-step protocol
- Analysis pipeline description
- Notes on variations or adaptations

## Related Workflows
- AnalyzePaper.md - Initial paper analysis
- UpdateKnowledgeBase.md - Save extracted protocols
